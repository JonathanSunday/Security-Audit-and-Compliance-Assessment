# Security Audit and Compliance Assessment

## Objective

This project aimed to perform a comprehensive audit of the entire security program at [redacted]. The primary focus was to assess existing assets, identify risks, and evaluate compliance with key regulations and standards to improve [redacted]'s overall security posture. This included identifying gaps in controls, developing recommendations, and utilizing the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) to guide the audit.

### Skills Learned

- Comprehensive understanding of the NIST CSF framework.
- Proficiency in performing risk assessments and evaluating compliance.
- Ability to identify and classify assets for better security management.
- Knowledge of implementing cybersecurity controls and compliance best practices.
- Development of practical strategies for mitigating risks and improving security postures.

### Tools Used

- Compliance and checklist frameworks (e.g., NIST CSF, PCI DSS, GDPR).
- Spreadsheet tools for control assessment and checklist documentation.
- Risk assessment frameworks for scoring and prioritization.
- Documentation and reporting tools for audit results and recommendations.

## Overview of Audit and Assessment
### Scope:
- The audit covered the entire security program, including all assets and internal processes.
- Assessed controls and compliance best practices to improve [redacted]'s security posture.

### Goals:
- Evaluate current assets and controls.
- Complete compliance and controls checklist.
- Provide actionable recommendations for improving security.

### Current Assets

#### Assets managed by the IT Department include:
- On-premises equipment for business needs.
- Employee devices: desktops, laptops, smartphones, remote workstations, peripherals.
- Storefront products and adjoining warehouse inventory.
- Management systems: accounting, telecom, database, security, ecommerce, and inventory.
- Internet access and internal network.
- Legacy systems requiring manual monitoring.

### Risk Assessment

#### Risk Description:
- Inadequate management of assets and controls.
- Potential non-compliance with U.S. and international regulations.

#### Control Best Practices:
- Identify and classify assets as per the NIST CSF Identify function.
- Determine the impact of asset loss on business continuity.

#### Risk Score:
- 8/10 (high risk due to insufficient controls and compliance).

### Additional Comments:
- Medium impact from asset loss due to unknown risk exposure.
- High risk of regulatory fines and data breaches.
